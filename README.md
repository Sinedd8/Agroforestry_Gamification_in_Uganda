## 👨‍💻 My Role

This was almost a **two-person thesis**. My teammate handled the **SEM (Structural Equation Modeling)**, while I was responsible for:

- All other statistical analyses (non-SEM)
- Visualizations, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis
- **Data cleaning, recoding, and formatting**
- Full collaboration on writing, design, survey structure
- Interpreting the outcomes and writing analysis sections

We shared every aspect of the project together, but I focused heavily on the **applied statistical analysis**, interpretation of results, and real-world linkage.
